# React-Tic-Tac-Toe
Solutions for the Tic Tac Toe game improvements challenge at the end of the official React tutorial.

Project started with create-react-app.

Initial commit is the `Final Result` of the [wrapping up](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up) section.

There are many ways to solve these problems, some better than others. The solutions offered here are just what I came up this weekend while feeling like going back to basics just for fun. There is undoubtedly better approaches.

The tutorial mentions:
> [Here] are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game which are listed in order of increasing difficulty

I have found that the `increasing difficulty` is hugely relative.
(For example, point 6, _the Draw scenario_, was the easiest to solve.)
